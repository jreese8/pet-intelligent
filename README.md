## Description
  Pet Intelligent is a faux, lite version of PetSmart and other similar pet-based eCommerce sites. You can browse through products and purchase them with Stripe. To complete a purchase, signing in or logging in is required. A map displays the location of my local PetCo since Pet Intelligent obviously does not exist. Finally, the contact form will send me emails.
